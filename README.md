# Backend part of Minecraft Server web app

This project is a React backend part of the whole app (backend section found in [here](https://github.com/Oskru/umgaming-frontend)) providing an ability to give a player logged in to the server a daily reward. <br><br>
I'm not really into creating MC server plugins, so integrating a well known web app with Minecraft's RCon protocool seemed like a way to go :)
